The Healer's Setback \n\n
Vaccination was built on a foundation\n
To protect the people in this nation.\n
Like the huge debate with Mather\n
Comes forth again the same matter.\n
Fast forward 300 years \n
And here we have the same old fears.\n
Why have we still to debate \n
About a conflict that abates \n
The very weapons that could have ended us? \n\n

Today, we fight against the very science and technology \n
That has helped us countlessly \n
With our everyday lives, \n
As if we curse our own aegis.\n
Why do we reach for the stars \n
Only to reject the very results we seek? \n
Why do we have to prove the healer’s credibility \n
When science has consummated its powers already? \n
What can we do to mold this stone wall of rigidity? \n\n

The best we can do is spread our wisdom \n
To eliminate all the harms from our system \n
And to those who think the healer harms, \n
And disapprove of its charms, \n
Believe in science, \n
Believe in research, \n
Believe in human advancement. \n
Don’t let this dogma become an attachment. \n
Keep an open mind \n
And help us survive \n
Overcome adversities \n
And continue to thrive.\n\n
